# Parch-and-Posey-Data-Analysis
This is my first project work as a data analyst student.
The Parch and Posey dataset is fictitious data to help educational purposes. 
It is a paper company with three paper types: standard, gloss and poster.
I generated 10 analytical questions used in the analysis of the data using Postgresql to query, manipulate
and understand it, finally using Tableau to visualise important insights to help aid the business decision process.
